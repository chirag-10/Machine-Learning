Machine-Learning

1) Neural Network(Deep-Learning Model) :
Dataset used is the famous Fashion-MNIST from Keras.
A sequential model API is used in this model.
Three different sub-models/neural networks are developed which differentiate in their number of neurons/units and hidden layers to get better accuracy.
Model was developed by using Jupyter Notebook as the IDE hence the (.ipynb) format.
Third Model with 2 hidden layers gives a training accuracy of 90% and test accuracy of 87%.
