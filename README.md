Machine-Learning

1)Neural Network(Deep-Learning Model) :
Dataset used is the famous Fashion-MNIST from Keras.
A sequential model API is used in this model.
Three different sub-models/neural networks are built which differentiate in their number of neurons/units and hidden layers to get better accuracy.
Model was developed by using Jupyter Notebook as the IDE hence the (.ipynb) format.
Third Model with 2 hidden layers gives a training accuracy of 90% and test accuracy of 87%.
Status:Incomplete

2)Comparing Different ML Algorithms:
In this ML model we have compared different types of ML algoritms i.e Support Vector Machine,Logistic Regression And K-Nearest Neighbours
over the same dataset of Iris flowers.
Comparison is done by using Histograms and BoxPlots.
Support Vector Machine is the most accurate model with an accuracy of 98% on this data.
Again,the data used was taken from Keras.
Libraries used are : Pandas,Scikit-Learn,tensorflow,matplotlib.
IDE used : Visual Studio Code
Status:Complete
